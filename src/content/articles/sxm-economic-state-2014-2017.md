Between 2014 and 2021, the economic development of Saint-Martin, a French overseas territory located in the Caribbean, faced significant obstacles due to two major phenomena: the passage of **Hurricane Irma** in late 2017 and the ongoing **Covid-19 pandemic** since 2020. These events had a profound impact on the island's economy, _leading to fluctuations in growth rates, a decline in population, and a setback in various sectors_.

## The Aftermath of Hurricane Irma and Population Changes:

The devastating impact of **Hurricane Irma** severely hampered the economic development of Saint-Martin. After experiencing a substantial _decline of 8.0%_ on average in 2017 and 2018, the economy bounced back with _a growth rate of 6.5%_ in 2019. However, the economic momentum was derailed once again by the Covid-19 crisis, resulting in a _recession of 12.5%_ in 2020. As a consequence, the GDP in 2021 showed timid growth **(+4.9%), but remained 17.2% lower in real terms than the level in 2016**. Additionally, the population of Saint-Martin _decreased by an average of 1.7% per year between 2014 and 2019_.

## Sectoral Impact and Slow Recovery:

Nearly all sectors of activity in Saint-Martin were affected by the combined impact of the climatic and health crises, except for the **construction, industry, and primarily non-market sectors**. The tourism sector, which is a vital component of the local economy, experienced a significant downturn due to both Hurricane Irma and the pandemic. The number of tourist arrivals declined after reaching its peak in 2014, with a sharp drop in 2017. Although tourist arrivals showed signs of recovery in 2019, surpassing two million visitors, the year 2020 brought a sudden halt to tourism on the island. In 2021, tourism remained significantly impacted by the lingering effects of the pandemic and the ongoing infrastructure reconstruction efforts, accounting for only 23% of pre-Irma levels on the French side.

The accommodation and restaurant sector, closely linked to tourism, suffered the most from the aftermath of Hurricane Irma and the Covid-19 crisis. The value added by this sector experienced substantial decreases in the years following the hurricane, followed by a partial recovery in 2019. However, the sector's value added plummeted once again in 2020 due to sanitary restrictions, with a partial rebound in 2021. Nevertheless, the sector still faces a significant gap _(-36.1%) compared to 2016, accounting for 4.1% of the total value added in 2021_.

The real estate sector also experienced negative consequences resulting from Hurricane Irma and subsequent population changes. After significant declines in value added in 2017 and 2018, the sector started to recover gradually, but it has not yet reached pre-hurricane levels. The decline in value added was associated with the decrease in population following the hurricane. In 2021, the **real estate sector** represented _12.3% of the total value added_.

The **commerce sector**, dependent on tourism to some extent, also suffered from the climatic events and the pandemic. Over the period from 2014 to 2021, the value added decreased _by 20.7%, particularly in 2017 and 2020_.

The transportation sector, directly linked to the tourism industry, experienced significant setbacks due to Hurricane Irma and the Covid-19 pandemic. The value added declined on average by 1.5% annually from 2014 to 2021. While the sector exhibited growth in 2019, the pandemic led to a sharp decrease in value added in 2020. However, there was a partial recovery in 2021, although still below the pre-Irma level.

## Conclusion:

The economic development of Saint-Martin faced formidable challenges between 2014 and 2021, primarily due to the aftermath of Hurricane Irma and the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. _These events led to fluctuations in growth rates, declines in population, and setbacks across various sectors_. Although some sectors showed signs of recovery, the overall economic performance remained below the levels achieved before these crises. The gradual reconstruction efforts and the continued support of both local and international stakeholders will be crucial for Saint-Martin to revive its economy and build a more resilient future.
