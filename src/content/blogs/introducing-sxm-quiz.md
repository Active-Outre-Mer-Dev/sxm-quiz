In this article we will quickly go over why SXM Quiz was created, some of our core features, and a sneek peek into what we have planned!

## How it Started

When we first started working on SXM Quiz, our initial goal was to create a simple website with quizzes related to Saint Martin so that tourists and locals could test their knowledge on the island.
After setting up our first version of the website along with gathering some information about the island for the quizzes, we encountered various issues:

- If users didn't know the solution for certain questions, it would be up to them to try and find the answers on their own
- Since the information on the website comes from multiple different sources, users would have to continuously jump from one corner of the web the next in order to find what they're looking for
- Finding accurate information about Saint Martin was proving to be a challenge

In order to address some of these issues, we've launched certain features that would ensure users have a smooth experience when using SXM Quiz.

## Learn as you play

Answering questions correctly is nice but what happens when you want to know **why** your answer is correct? With SXM Quiz, you can easily learn little facts about Saint Martin by reading the details of each correct question in a quiz.

The option to learn quick facts about the island while playing might be a nice feature, but what if you want to fall into the rabbit hole and learn everything there is about Saint Martin?

## For the Community...

Along with being able to test your knowledge on Saint Martin, you will know be able to strengthen it to your hearts content with our new [learn section](/learn). The idea is to have a centralized learning area so you don't have to stress about finding information yourself.

Additionally, while attempting a quiz, you can conveniently see all articles related to it, allowing you to quickly view the exact information you need in great detail.

## ...By the Community

It wasn't long until we noticed that not all information about Saint Martin is online or in books. In most cases, the community will be able to teach you more about the island than any article you might find online! But unless that knowledge is written down, it is at a risk of being lost as time passes by.

With SXM Quiz, anyone who has something to share will be able to:

- Create and publish articles
- Fact check and improve articles written by other community members
- Implement new features and help improve the overall website if you're a developer!

Whether you're an individual who wants to share their extensive knowledge about the island, or a developer who wants to help build something great, then this might be the perfect place for you!

## What's next

Although we've hit a major milestone with the release of this website, we are still determined on improving SXM Quiz and making it the ideal platform for users to learn and share facts about Saint Martin.

Here are a few things that the team will be working on in the upcoming weeks:

- Improving the experience of publishing and writing articles for community members
- Adding multiple different types of quizzes for variety
- Covering more topics about the island

and much more!
